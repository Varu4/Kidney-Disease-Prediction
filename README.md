##  Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
 This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help in early diagnosis and provide doctors and patients with insights based on health parameters.

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
1. Built a machine learning model to classify whether a patient is likely to have kidney disease.
2. Dataset includes medical parameters such as serum creatinine, blood urea, albumin, blood pressure, diabetes, hypertension, etc.
3. Applied data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier handling to improve data quality.
4. Trained and tested models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

ðŸ”¹ Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing
   Handled missing values
   Treated outliers using the median
   Encoded categorical variables

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   Visualized distribution of features
   Identified key risk factors (e.g., creatinine, blood urea, albumin, hypertension, diabetes)

3. Model Building
   Trained multiple ML models
   Compared performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
   Selected best-performing model

4. Results
   The model provides reliable predictions for kidney disease
   Helps in early detection and preventive treatment

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
   Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
   Jupyter Notebook for implementation
   Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
